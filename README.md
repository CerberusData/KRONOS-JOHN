# **Medussa Project**

<!-- 
Badges: On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such 
as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields 
to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a 
badge.  
Visuals: Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include 
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos)
Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

[**Kiwibot**](https://www.kiwibot.com/) links on-demand customers with you, we move atoms from point A to B in a safe, efficient, and affordable way. We are improving people's lives with the world's most affordable and technologic delivery service for local commerce around the world, Since our start in 2017, *Kiwibot* has made over 90,000 deliveries and built over 200 robots to be the number one robot delivery platform on earth.

Since early stages **Kiwibot** has shown amazing ideas, strategies, and developments to propose a new way to perform the last mile delivery, all of that was embodied in a single box (Our first version); however, over the years, and different versions we improved significantly in our logistics, operations, design, and specially the software by using not only pure Robotics but Artificial Intelligence as well. At this stage we are ready to perform new, and astonishing developments for our industry as a world leading company in the last mile delivery with Robots with a new version.

Kiwibot v1.0 | Kiwibot v2.0 | Kiwibot v3.0 | Kiwibot v4.0

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and 
add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features 
or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives 
to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.  -->

## **Description**

**Medusa Project** will contain within an amazing development environment all the software for the new version of the [*Kiwibot*](https://www.kiwibot.com/). By providing a completely new development environment with the most powerful tools for our developers, we will be able to focus on what is important for us: Make the best *Kiwibot* you've ever seen. We want to give a step forward in every single aspect to keep our little friend at the very top in this field.

## **Motivation**

We have been recollecting, and reusing many old scripts from the last two *Kiwibot* versions (*Rover 2.x*, and *Apollo 3.x*), which have led to a considerable technical debt. With that factor in mind with this project we want to provide a wide range of advantages as stated below:

  * The base image, and the requirements are allocated in this [repository](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project).
  * The package requirements are managed in the right way ([Good practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/s)).
  * An easy way to contribute, and develop packages for Kiwibot 4.x which is a [ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/) based platform.
  * An easy, and fast setup for installation of developer tools within a [Dev Container for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## **Project architecture**


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- 
Installation: Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of 
installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the 
possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more 
guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using 
your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like 
a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies 
that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.  

Usage: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's 
helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, 
while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to 
reasonably include in the README. 
-->

Find useful information of: 
- [Balena](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena/): Balena primer (Good overall description about this incredible platform).

## **Installation Requirements**

A recommendation is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main IDE for development. Also:

   1. [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
   2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

And for the extensions required:

   1. [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

As far for installation requirements, the required secrets should be present in:

   1. `balena_cli_configs/token` --> Token so that `balena-cli` can work without problems. Get it on [balena access-tokens page](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/preferences/access-tokens)
   2. `ssh-keys/id_balena` and `ssh-keys/id_balena.pubkey` --> Pair of ssh keys that should be registered in [balena cloud](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/preferences/sshkeys)

Please stick to the provided names, otherwise it won't work as out-of-the-box. Also **DO NOT ADD SECRETS TO THE REPO**.

### **Add-ons Provided**
We are providing the [balena staged-releases](https://github.com/balena-io-projects/staged-releases) as a `git submodule`, you can init the submodule and change the required variables in:

   * `staged-releases/balena.env`

## **Running our stack**

Find a brief explanation on how to run our stack in your IDE and the explanation of the launch file as this is the key to manage which nodes are going to be launched.

### **Python script bot.launch.py**
This script contains the nodes information and arguments within our ROS 2 development workspace in order to launch them in a single command (ros2 launch <name>). Please note that this is the standard form to launch nodes in ROS 2.

   - Vision nodes
      - NODE_VIDEO_MAPPING
      - NODE_VIDEO_CALIBRATION
      - NODE_VIDEO_PARTICLE
      - NODE_LOCAL_CONSOLE

   - Control nodes
      - NODE_CANLINK_CHASSIS
      - NODE_CANLINK_CABIN
   
   - Local client node
      - NODE_LOCAL_CLIENT
   
   - Data capture node
      - NODE_DATA_CAPTURE

Set the `default` argument to 1 or 0 to launch a node (Within the described file). This can also be set at `nodes_local_launch.yaml` which will be created when you run the `startBot.sh` script.

### **Starting the Bot**
In order to launch locally (Inside your IDE), please locate into the`configs/` folder and please execute the following bash command.

> bash startBot.sh start

This bash performs the following steps to launch the *Kiwibot* stack:

1. Sources the `local_env_vars.sh` which contains the *Kiwibot* local environment variables. 
2. Creates a local configuration file for the cameras.

For ROS 2 development workspace

1. Sources ROS Dashing and clean the older development workspace.
2. Builds the development workspace at `rover/ros2/`
3. Sources the resulting setup in the install folder `. install/setup.bash`
4. Downloads and runs the SocketIO server for *Kiwibot* local console.
5. Executes `ros2 launch /configs/bot.launch.py`


<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for 
accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some 
documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should 
run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. 
These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help 
to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes 
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is 
especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium 
server for testing in a browser.  -->

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from everyone, and to ensure our community stays open and healthy we adhere to the Contributor Covenant, a widely used code of conduct adopted by many other communities such as Linux, Ruby on Rails and GitLab. Everyone participating in the *Kiwibot* development is expected to follow the code of conduct. If someone in the community happens to be violating these terms, please let the project leads know, and we will address it as soon as possible.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Support: Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any 
combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.  -->
