# **Medussa Project**

<!-- 
Badges: On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such 
as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields 
to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a 
badge.  
Visuals: Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include 
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos)
Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

[**Kiwibot**](https://www.kiwibot.com/) links on-demand customers with you, we move atoms from point A to B in a safe, efficient, and affordable way. We are improving people's lives with the world's most affordable and technologic delivery service for local commerce around the world, Since our start in 2017, *Kiwibot* has made over 90,000 deliveries and built over 200 robots to be the number one robot delivery platform on earth.

Since early stages **Kiwibot** has shown amazing ideas, strategies, and developments to propose a new way to perform the last-mile delivery, all of that was embodied in a single box (Our first version); however, over the years, and different versions we improved significantly in our logistics, operations, design, and especially the software by using not only pure Robotics but Artificial Intelligence as well. At this stage, we are ready to perform new, and astonishing developments for our industry as a world-leading company in the last mile delivery with Robots with a new version.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and 
add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A trrlist of Features 
or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives 
to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.  -->

## **Description**

**Medusa Project** will contain within an amazing development environment all the software for the new version of the [*Kiwibot*](https://www.kiwibot.com/). By providing a completely new development environment with the most powerful tools for our developers, we will be able to focus on what is important for us: Make the best *Kiwibot* you've ever seen. We want to give a step forward in every single aspect to keep our little friend at the very top in this field.

## **Motivation**

We have been recollecting, and reusing many old scripts from the last two *Kiwibot* versions (*Rover 2.x*, and *Apollo 3.x*), which have led to a considerable technical debt. With that factor in mind with this project we want to provide a wide range of advantages as stated below:

  * The base image, and the requirements are allocated in this [repository](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project).
  * The package requirements are managed in the right way ([Good practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/s)).
  * An easy way to contribute, and develop packages for Kiwibot 4.x which is a [ROS 2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/) based platform.
  * An easy, and fast setup for installation of developer tools within a [Dev Container for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!-- 
Installation: Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of 
installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the 
possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more 
guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using 
your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like 
a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies 
that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.  

Usage: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's 
helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, 
while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to 
reasonably include in the README. 
-->

## **Installation & Requirements**

A recommendation is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main IDE for development. Make sure you also have installed:

   1. [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
   2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
   3. [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extensions for VSCode
   4. [Ubuntu 18.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)

## **Running the Dev-Container**

If you have your [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the right extensions, and if you have Docker and Docker-compose installed in your system, when you open the Mudussa Project's main folder you'll see a window on the bottom right corner, click in "reopen in container" button, if you don't see anything press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in container` option. When the container is opened, and executed for the first time or when there're changes on it, you can go for a walk because the building image process will start which it'll take a while due to the installation of all packages and dependencies of the dev-environment as [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and more stuff related to, while the process is complete here are some videos of [puppies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRf3-JkwqfU). You can see at any time the logs of the building process clicking in `Starting with Dev Container` on the bottom right corner. When the process is done you'll see some messages of process succeed.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43115782/87437367-d5806200-c5b3-11ea-9bf2-836e45f46ed8.gif" alt="building_dev-container" width="1200"> 

When the process is done you can open a terminal in the dev-container going to the menu bar `Terminal` and then `New Terminal`. Congratulations now you have everything that we use for our deployments and developments.

## **(Optional) Balena for Code Deployment**

As far for production requirements, the required secrets should be present in:

   1. `balena_cli_configs/token` --> Token so that `balena-cli` can work without problems. Get it on [balena access-tokens page](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/preferences/access-tokens)
   2. `ssh-keys/id_balena` and `ssh-keys/id_balena.pub` --> Pair of public and private [ssh keys](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.html) that should be registered in [balena cloud](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/preferences/sshkeys).

Please stick to the provided names, otherwise it won't work as out-of-the-box. Notice you shouldn't **ADD SECRET KEYS TO THE REPO**.

Find useful information of: 
- [Balena](https://www.balena.io/what-is-balena/): Balena primer (Good overall description about this incredible platform).

**Add-ons Provided**: We are providing the [balena staged-releases](https://github.com/balena-io-projects/staged-releases) as a `git submodule`, you can init the submodule and change the required variables in:

   * `staged-releases/balena.env`

## **Running The Kiwibot Stack**

Find a brief explanation on how to run our stack in your IDE and the explanation of the launch file, and config files as the key to managing which nodes are going to be launched and how they're going to work.

In order to launch locally (Inside your IDE), please locate into the `rover/` folder in the dev-container terminal and execute the following promt command:

      bash config/startBot.sh start

This bash performs the following steps to launch the *Kiwibot* stack:

1. Sources the [`local_env_vars.sh`](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/blob/master/rover/configs/local_env_vars.sh) which contains the *Kiwibot* local environment variables. 
2. Creates a local configuration file for the cameras (`cams_conf_local.yaml`).
3. [On firsts run] downloads [cv-bridge package for ros2](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv)
4. [On firsts run] downloads, install, and upgrade [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
5. [On firsts run] downloads, and compile the [SocketIO server](https://github.com/kiwicampus/socketio-server) for *Kiwibot* local console.

For ROS 2 development workspace

1. Sources ROS Dashing and clean the older development workspace (If enabled).
2. Builds the development workspace at `rover/ros2/`
3. Sources the resulting setup in the install folder `. install/setup.bash`
4. Executes `ros2 launch /configs/bot.launch.py`

You can compile and launch everything by your own if you already have a background an experience with ROS/ROS2, but for those who want everything easy, and fast the bash script will set up and run everything for you. With the [``startBot.sh``](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/blob/master/rover/configs/startBot.sh) bash script you can run the stack of the robot, this file has all instruction to download third-party packages, other required dependencies if they're missing, and setup, source, and run the ros2 workspace, launching the nodes specified in the file ``nodes_local_launch.yaml`` (File created when you start or run the script for the first time). 

The script creates missing files when is launched for the first time, so, you have to run the script again every time that a missing file is detected. You'll see some logs as shown below:

      Starting Robot
      /workspace/rover/configs/cams_conf_local.yaml no exist, creating one
      cams_conf_local.yaml file created, run again script!
      socketio-server installed, run again script!

When the script finishes the building, and the compilation process you'll see the local console window with default configs as shown next:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43115782/87437303-beda0b00-c5b3-11ea-8bdb-3a3d050a4fab.gif" alt="starting_kiwibot" width="1200"> 

*Note:* if you are having troubles or errors getting the user interface window, read about [Docker image with OpenCV with X11 forwarding for GUI](https://marcosnietoblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/30/docker-image-with-opencv-with-x11-forwarding-for-gui/) for explanations, and then run the  [``startXHost.sh``](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/blob/feature/readme/rover/configs/startXHost.sh) script in the host terminal, or just run the prompt command (Do not this in the dev-container terminal):

      xhost +

## **Launching Specific Nodes**

The file ``nodes_local_launch.yaml`` created by [``bot.launch.py ``](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/blob/master/rover/configs/bot.launch.py) if there's no one when running [``startBot.sh``](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/blob/master/rover/configs/startBot.sh), allows to you to select or config the nodes that you want to run. 

In ``nodes_local_launch.yaml`` set the argument ``launch`` of every element in the yaml list to 1 or 0 to launch a node or not. Belows there's a description of the actually node by packages that currently the project has:

   - [``Vision nodes``](rover/ros2/src/vision):Nodes, and packages for cameras handling, computer vision, and vision perception algorithms, and other vision utils
      - [``NODE_VIDEO_MAPPING``](rover/ros2/src/vision/node_video_mapping.py): Cameras handling, video streaming publishers, and local user graphics
      - NODE_VIDEO_CALIBRATION: Cameras stereo and mono calibration algorithms
      - NODE_VIDEO_PARTICLE: Cameras stereo and mono calibration algorithms
      - NODE_LOCAL_CONSOLE:

   - Control nodes
      - NODE_CANLINK_CHASSIS: Managment of the connection between the main board and the kiwibot's system. This node contains the logic and tools to read and share, the battery status, the chassis status (Including motors), as well as managing of other chassis and control features.
      - NODE_CANLINK_CABIN: Similar to the Chassis Node it is on charge of managing the lock system and the lights of the robot.
   
   - Local client node
      - NODE_LOCAL_CLIENT:
   
   - Data capture node
      - NODE_DATA_CAPTURE:

You can launch them in a single command (ros2 launch <name>) if you want as well, please note that this is the standard form to launch nodes in ROS 2.

For more config files check the [configs](https://github.com/kiwicampus/medusa-project/tree/master/rover/configs) folder.

## **Launching Local Console**

<!-- State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for 
accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some 
documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should 
run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. 
These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help 
to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes 
inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is 
especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium 
server for testing in a browser.  -->
